    https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

    Java Version: JDK-21

    Problem Description:

        Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
            -> return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

        You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
            -> and you may not use the same element twice.

        You can return the answer in any order.

        Follow-up:
            Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n^2) time complexity?
